# GitHub Issues for Todo App

The following GitHub issues should be created to address the problems in the codebase:

## Issue 1: Missing Database Implementation

**Title:** Missing Database Implementation

**Body:**
```
## Issue

Drizzle ORM is listed as a dependency but there are no schema files, models, or database connection code.

## Impact

The application cannot store or retrieve any todo data without a database implementation.

## Recommendation

Create database schema and models for todo items with the following steps:

1. Create a database connection file
2. Define schema for todo items (at minimum: id, title, completed, userId)
3. Set up proper relations between users and todos
4. Implement proper database queries

## Priority

High - This is a critical component for a functional todo application.
```

## Issue 2: Missing Todo Functionality

**Title:** Implement Todo CRUD Functionality 

**Body:**
```
## Issue

Despite being a "Todo App", there is no functionality for creating, reading, updating, or deleting todos.

## Impact

The application doesn't fulfill its core purpose.

## Recommendation

Implement the following features:
1. Todo creation form
2. Todo list display
3. Todo completion toggle
4. Todo deletion
5. Todo editing

## Priority

High - This is the core functionality of the application.
```

## Issue 3: Incomplete Authentication Implementation

**Title:** Complete Clerk Authentication Implementation

**Body:**
```
## Issue

Authentication is set up with Clerk, but no user-specific functionality is implemented.

## Impact

Users can authenticate but have no user-specific data or actions.

## Recommendation

1. Link todos to authenticated users
2. Add proper data isolation between users
3. Implement user profile page with settings
4. Add proper redirects for unauthenticated users

## Priority

Medium - Authentication is configured but not properly utilized.
```

## Issue 4: Missing API Routes for Todo Operations

**Title:** Implement API Routes for Todo Operations

**Body:**
```
## Issue

No API routes exist for todo operations.

## Impact

Frontend components have no way to interact with the backend/database.

## Recommendation

Create API routes for:
1. GET /api/todos - List todos
2. POST /api/todos - Create todo
3. PUT /api/todos/:id - Update todo
4. DELETE /api/todos/:id - Delete todo

Ensure all routes are properly authenticated and validate input data.

## Priority

High - Required for frontend-backend communication.
```

## Issue 5: Replace Default Next.js Boilerplate UI

**Title:** Replace Default Next.js Boilerplate UI

**Body:**
```
## Issue

The home page is still using the default Next.js boilerplate.

## Impact

The application doesn't have a proper todo interface.

## Recommendation

1. Create a custom UI for the todo application
2. Implement a todo list view
3. Add input form for new todos
4. Add completion and deletion controls
5. Implement responsive design for mobile devices

## Priority

Medium - Functional UI needed for application usage.
