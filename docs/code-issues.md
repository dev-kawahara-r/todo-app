# Code Issues and Improvement Opportunities

Based on analysis of the Todo App codebase, the following issues and improvement opportunities have been identified:

## Critical Issues

### 1. Missing Database Implementation
- **Issue**: Drizzle ORM is listed as a dependency but there are no schema files, models, or database connection code.
- **Impact**: The application cannot store or retrieve any todo data without a database implementation.
- **Recommendation**: Create database schema and models for todo items.

### 2. Missing Todo Functionality
- **Issue**: Despite being a "Todo App", there is no functionality for creating, reading, updating, or deleting todos.
- **Impact**: The application doesn't fulfill its core purpose.
- **Recommendation**: Implement CRUD operations for todo management.

## Improvement Opportunities

### 1. Incomplete Clerk Implementation
- **Issue**: Authentication is set up but no user-specific functionality is implemented.
- **Recommendation**: Add user-specific todo lists and data isolation.

### 2. Inconsistent Edge Runtime Configuration
- **Issue**: Edge runtime is enabled in page.tsx and layout.tsx but commented out in middleware.ts.
- **Recommendation**: Be consistent with runtime declarations across files.

### 3. Empty Next.js Configuration
- **Issue**: next.config.ts has an empty configuration object.
- **Recommendation**: Add necessary configuration for deployment and features.

### 4. Unoptimized Font Loading
- **Issue**: Using font-family CSS property with variables that aren't defined.
- **Recommendation**: Properly set up Next.js font loading or update CSS.

### 5. Missing Component Structure 
- **Issue**: No reusable components for todo items, forms, etc.
- **Recommendation**: Create a component structure for the application.

### 6. Missing API Routes
- **Issue**: No API routes for todo operations.
- **Recommendation**: Implement API routes to handle todo CRUD operations.

### 7. Missing Error Handling
- **Issue**: No error handling for authentication or data operations.
- **Recommendation**: Implement proper error handling throughout the application.

### 8. Missing Tests
- **Issue**: No test files or testing framework implementation.
- **Recommendation**: Set up testing for components and functionality.

### 9. Default Boilerplate Page
- **Issue**: The home page is still using default Next.js boilerplate.
- **Recommendation**: Replace with a custom Todo application interface.

### 10. Incomplete TypeScript Types
- **Issue**: Missing TypeScript types for todo models and app state.
- **Recommendation**: Create comprehensive type definitions for all entities.
